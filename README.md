### Explanation of Key Concepts in the C Code:

1. **Struct (Yapı)**:
   - A `struct` in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different types under a single name. Each member (variable) in the struct has its own memory space.
   - For example, in the code, the `structTest` struct has two integers, `a` and `b`. They can be accessed individually using the struct's name, such as `structTest.a` and `structTest.b`.
   - A key feature of `struct` is that each member of the struct has its own address in memory.

2. **Union (Birleşim)**:
   - A `union` in C is similar to a struct but with a critical difference: all members of a union share the same memory location. This means that only one member of the union can hold a value at any given time.
   - The `unionTest` union in the example holds two integers, `m` and `n`. They share the same memory space, so modifying one will affect the other.
   - The size of a union is determined by the size of its largest member, unlike a struct where memory is allocated for all its members.

3. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `sizeof` is used to determine the memory size of a struct or union. For a struct, this is the sum of the sizes of its individual members, while for a union, it’s the size of the largest member, as all members share the same space.
   - For example, `sizeof(structTest)` gives the total memory required by the struct, while `sizeof(unionTest)` gives the memory needed for the largest variable in the union.

4. **Pointer Usage**:
   - In the code, pointers like `A`, `B`, `M`, and `N` are used to point to the memory addresses of the struct and union members.
   - Pointers are crucial in C for efficiently accessing and manipulating memory, particularly when working with complex data structures like structs and unions.

5. **Difference Between Struct and Union**:
   - **Struct**: Each member has its own memory space, and all can hold values simultaneously.
   - **Union**: All members share the same memory space, and only one member can hold a value at a time. This makes unions more memory-efficient, but you lose the ability to store multiple values at once.

This code demonstrates how to define and use both structs and unions, highlighting their differences in memory management and usage in C.
